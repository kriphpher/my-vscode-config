<h3>my-vscode-config</h3>
<p>Visual Studio Code is my main Code Editor, but now as you can see on my GitHub profile I'm tring to learn how to use NeoVim...So I have two Code Editors configs, feel free to use and make changes for yourself</p>
<ul>
  <li>VSCode Main Configs</li>
  <li>Plugins Configs</li>
</ul>
